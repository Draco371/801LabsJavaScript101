CLI Javascript is a virtual machine that runs with user priveleges on a system. Can read and write files, do network communication, and destroy your system if you run or write a malicious script.

## Q: What is an SSH key?

An SSh key is an encryption tool that comes in two halves, a public and private key. The public key can be shared with anyone in order to decrypt messages from a certain private key. It can also be used to encrypt messages that can only be unencrypted by a private key.

The instructions for creating a new SSH key pair can be done through this link: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
